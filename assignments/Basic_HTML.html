				<summary><b>Kodiak Bear Fact Sheet</b></summary>
				<ul>
					<li>Kodiak bears are a unique subspecies of the brown or grizzly bear (Ursus arctos middendorffi).
					They live exclusively on the islands in the Kodiak Archipelago and have been isolated from other 
					bears for about <time datetime="P4380000D">12,000 years.</time></li>
				
					<li>Kodiak bear populations are healthy and productive. They enjoy relatively pristine habitat and 
					well managed fish populations. In most areas the number of bears is stable, but there are some places 
					where bear density is increasing.</li>
				
					<li>Male bears are called boars, females are sows, and youngsters are cubs.</li>
				
					<li>Kodiak bears are the largest bears in the world. A large male can stand over 10' tall when on his 
					hind legs, and 5' when on all four legs. They weigh up to 1,500 pounds. Females are about 20% smaller, 
					and 30% lighter than males.<br /></li>
				
					<li>The oldest known wild Kodiak bear was a 34-year-old sow. The oldest boar was 27.</li>
				
					<li>Cubs are born in the den during January or February. Weighing less than a pound at birth with little hair 
					and closed eyes, they suckle for several months, emerging from the den in May or June, weighing 15-20 pounds.</li>
