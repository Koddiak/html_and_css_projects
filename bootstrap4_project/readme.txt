The reason there's two versions of the project is that I didn't immediately click next after 
getting instructions from the video on page 358. Because of this, I didn't think to use the card component
provided by Bootstrap until after completing the assignment my way. It took me a while to complete
it so it would have been a little painful to not include it, so here they are. The column method and 
the card method.
